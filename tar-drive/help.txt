Help document for the kernel
============================

Welcome to the kernel user manual.

First of all, this is a long document. When you want to go back to the shell
just press 'q'. If the clock bothers you, run the command `pkill time-display`.

The kernel consists of various systems, you can find a short guide in this
file.

# Multitasking

At this point, the kernel supports cooperative multitasking. This means that
multiple processes can run at the same time, and they are switched whenever
they call yield().

# File access

## ATA Driver

The kernel is able to read data from ATA Disks. There is a driver process
called ata-driver. But this is a low level interface, you can only read whole
sectors with it. Other file system drivers build on top of ata-driver to
provide file-level access.

## tarfs

tarfs is the built-in filesystem. It can work with hard drives formatted as a
tar file.

# Serial port

The kernel regularly logs to the serial port.
